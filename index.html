      <h2>Comparing My 2018 Egypt Experience to People's Experiences During the
        Pandemic</h2>
      <h4>By: Renee Onque | May 11, 2021</h4>

    <div class="container">
      <p>In 2018, I had one of the most amazing travel experiences ever when I hopped on an eleven-hour long flight to Cairo, Egypt. An opportunity that fell into my lap unexpectedly, quickly turned into my first time flying out of the country. Two
        years later, everything changed when the COVID-19 caused the first global pandemic since 1919. People lost their jobs, and some people even lost their lives and continue to over a year later.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, tourism was dramatically affected and is still feeling the aftermath of the pandemic, Egypt especially.</p>

          <h4>Taken On the Nile Cruise</h4>
          <p>In 2018, being on a cruise, sailing the Nile River was a dream come true for me. My travel group and other travel groups danced together and sang songs in the main room after dinner. People celebrated their birthdays and wedding
            anniversaries.</p>
          <p>It was the definition of family-oriented even though many of us barely knew each other. It is a memory that I will always cherish.</p>

          <p>Two years later, that same experience turned into a nightmare for travelers who were forced to stay on the water after someone contracted the coronavirus.</p>

      <h3>The Pyramids of Giza</h3>

          <p>One of the main attractions in Cairo are the pyramids at Giza. Giza is the home of three amazing structures, including the Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre and the Pyramid of Menkaure. Not too far from the three major pyramids,
            stands the North Pyramid, also known as the Red Pyramid. I had the absolute pleasure of being able to enter the Red Pyramid.</p>
          <p>I was stunned stepping inside of a pyramid with my classmates. We weren&rsquo;t the only ones venturing inside. Around and inside of the pyramid were lots of people, also amazed at what they were seeing.</p>

          <p>Janet Moore&rsquo;s experience was much different than mine. She told LA Times: &ldquo;I was the only human being in the entire pyramid complex except for security and the guys with the camels. No other tourists.&rdquo; Her testimony
            goes to show that tourism in Egypt has taken a sharp decline in comparison to what things were like in 2018.</p>

          <p>An amazing site in Cairo is also the Great Sphinx of Giza. When I visited this beauty, I was greeted by an amazing tour guide who took my favorite picture ever. She angled the camera so that it looked like I was kissing the sphinx. She
            described taking pictures of people in front of the sphinx as one of her favorite parts of her job.</p>

          <p>Similar to the tour guide who assisted me in front of the Sphinx, Shahenda Adel&rsquo;s income relied solely on tourism. She told BBC that once travel restrictions were put in place, she immediately lost 1,000 bookings. She explained
            that she wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was affected by this major shift, &ldquo;We had to cancel hotels - and that involves everyone who works in the hotel, the travel company itself, all the people behind desks. We all lost our jobs. And
            then you have drivers and restaurants,&rdquo; she told BBC.</p>

      <p>Egypt would greatly benefit from a rise in tourism and many predict that they will make a swift return by fall of 2022. But that starts with tourists returning and enjoying the full experience that Egypt has to offer. It was one of the
        best experiences of my life and could be for you, too!</p>
